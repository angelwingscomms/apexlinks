always a lotta liquid glass glassmorphic styles throughout using tailwind and flowbite
elements have frosted glass backgrounds where main page abstract element art backgrounds softly show through
always use a lotta animations and transitions using animejs
dreamy ethereal styles

create with a lot of freedom, and if you have any idea for anything that will go well with an image that doesn't exist, create the ui for the image, with the dimensions so it's like a placeholder in the ui, and make the alt of the placeholder a prompt for an image to be created with AI, and also tell me every image to be created in your response

do a lott

## IMPORTANT: Tailwind CSS v4 Configuration
This project uses Tailwind CSS v4 which has a DIFFERENT configuration approach than v3:

**NEVER create tailwind.config.js** - v4 uses `@theme` directive in CSS files instead

**Correct v4 approach:**
- Use `@import 'tailwindcss';` in CSS files
- Configure theme using `@theme { }` directive in CSS
- Define custom utilities in `@layer utilities { }`
- Define components in `@layer components { }`

**Theme variables format:**
```css
@theme {
  --color-primary: #0ea5e9;
  --color-accent: #f59e0b;
  --shadow-neumorphic: 15px 15px 30px rgba(14, 165, 233, 0.1), -15px -15px 30px rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.8);
}
```

**v3 vs v4 compatibility:**
- v3 config files (tailwind.config.js) are INCOMPATIBLE with v4
- Flowbite components need to be recreated in v4 syntax
- Custom utilities must use direct CSS properties, not Tailwind classes
