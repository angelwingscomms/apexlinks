    user zone management
        join zone
            params
                zone_id
            steps
                add user to zone
                update user's zone field

        leave zone

                zone_id
            restrictions
                users can only leave zones they created
            steps
                remove user from zone
                update user's zone field

        create zone
            automatically joins user to created zone

    product/service inheritance
        when product or service is created
            inherits from creating user:
                z - zone
                l - location url  
                p - position lat and long

                        location url (can be selected on google maps embed)

                    optional
                        images

                steps
                    llm (gemma (check net how to use gemma via http)) checks if similar zone already exists by using embedding search and looking at first 18 results
                        if similar zone already exists it responds that similar zone already exists, i think it should also check if the similar zone is in the same or a near location and if it isn't go ahead to create it

                    adds images to ibm-cos-sdk (check net how to use it w http and tell me what variables you'll need)

                    create embedding from zone name and description json

                    adds deets to qdrant

                    responds with id

                    search qdrant on collection `i` filter s: `z`
                    support location-based search (e.g. within 50 miles)
