# Global Routing Convention
All sites must use the dynamic routing method as used in `site`: `<resource>/i?i=<resource_id>` for resource detail pages.

edits to be made to ./site

some of these may be already (partially or fully) implemented

---

the site's main focus for now is to allow users catalogue their products and services.&#x20;

# homepage

instead of a search page/button/cta on/as the homepage, the homepage lets the user clearly know that the site allows them to easily and beautifully catalogue their products/services for their (potential) customers and the general public. the site allows your catalogue to be color/font/style themed anyhow you like, allows users to search through your products with AI and filters, talk to AI about your products to discover the best thing for them that you have, and also answer any questions or clear up any unclear stuff they may have about your product.  users can find similar items to an item in your catalogue. After the homepage, the user catalogue page would be implemented, which would be a page at /c?i=\<user\_id>, so a search can be done on a catalogue, filtered by product, service, or both, filtered by price range and any custom filters available on the item

# item add page (/i/add):

choose type (product/service)

text input - text name

upload primary image

upload images

text area  - item description

add values for custom fields:

custom fields are numeric or text fields the user have set on their account so any of their items can have values for any of those fields. the input for a custom field is numeric or text based on the field's type. custom fields are fetched from the user's profile on page load

# &#x20;edit profile page /edit

username text input

description text area

primary image

images

address input: address, state, country

location input: select location w/ pin from Google Maps embed

add/edit/delete custom fields

custom fields have a label and type\:number/text

in the db, custom fields are stored as JSON in the \`cf\` field of the user db object

# user detail page /u?i=\<uuid>

name

user's primary image

horizontal scrolling bar of user's images

address

user description

# item detail page /i?i=\<uuid>

name

item's primary image

horizontal scrolling bar of item's images

address

item description

# Glassmorphic Design Update Todo

## Overview
We've updated our design approach from neumorphic to glassmorphic for all SvelteKit sites. This todo file contains instructions for completing the transition.

## CSS Changes Already Made
- Updated app.css files with new glassmorphic design variables
- Replaced neumorphic utility classes with glass equivalents
- Updated component classes in CSS

## Component Updates Needed
The following class replacements should be made across all components:

| Old (Neumorphic) | New (Glassmorphic) |
|------------------|-------------------|
| .neumorphic | .glass |
| .neumorphic-inset | .glass-sm |
| .neumorphic-sm | .glass-sm |
| .neumorphic-accent | .glass-accent |
| .neumorphic-button | .glass-button |
| .card-neumorphic | .card-glass |
| .input-neumorphic | .input-glass |

## Files Already Updated
- aw/src/app.css
- site/src/app.css
- site/src/lib/components/UserCard.svelte
- site/src/lib/components/ProfileEditForm.svelte
- site/src/lib/components/Navbar.svelte
- README.md

## Files To Update
Use the grep search results to identify all components that use neumorphic classes and update them:

### High Priority
- site/src/lib/components/SimilarityDisplay.svelte
- site/src/lib/components/UserSearchForm.svelte
- site/src/routes/profile/+page.svelte
- site/src/routes/users/+page.svelte
- site/src/routes/profile/edit/+page.svelte
- site/src/routes/users/[id]/+page.svelte
- site/src/routes/+page.svelte
- aw/src/lib/FloatingActionButton.svelte

### Secondary Priority
- site/src/routes/zones/+page.svelte
- site/src/routes/auth/callback/+page.svelte
- aw/src/routes/classes/grade-1/+page.svelte
- aw/src/routes/classes/grade-2/+page.svelte
- aw/src/routes/classes/grade-3/+page.svelte
- aw/src/routes/classes/nursery-2/+page.svelte
- aw/src/routes/clubs/robotics/+page.svelte

## Design Guidelines for Glassmorphic Style
- Use light backgrounds with transparency (rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.15) to rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.3))
- Apply backdrop-filter: blur(15px) to create the frosted glass effect
- Use subtle borders (1px solid rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.2))
- Apply subtle shadows for depth (0 8px 32px rgba(14, 165, 233, 0.2))
- Maintain rounded corners (border-radius: 1.5rem for cards, 1rem for smaller elements)
