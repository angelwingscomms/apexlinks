These rules cover the backend subdir and every sveltekit static site subdir

144 is the backend for all the sites

Always think like a professional creative designer that works in a professional highend design studio that does work for fortune 500 companies like Apple and Nike

always a lot of neumorphic styles throughout using tailwind and flowbite
always use transitions for all navigation and actions, using animejs

create with a lot of freedom, and if you have any idea for anything that will go well with an image that doesn't exist, create the ui for the image, with the dimensions so it's like a placeholder in the ui, and make the alt of the placeholder a prompt for an image to be created with AI, and also tell me every image to be created in your response

All SvelteKit sites (all folders in repo besides .cursor and 144) are static sveltekit sites. has no server routes, no server/page load functions, everything happens directly in the browser. http w axios, always. tailwind and flowbite always for all styles. for the backend, use existing conventions.

## CRITICAL: Tailwind CSS v4 Configuration
All SvelteKit sites in this repo use Tailwind CSS v4 with specific configuration requirements:

**NEVER create tailwind.config.js** - v4 is incompatible with v3 config files

**Required v4 setup:**
- Use `@import 'tailwindcss';` in app.css
- Configure theme using `@theme { }` directive in CSS files
- Define custom utilities in `@layer utilities { }`
- Define Flowbite-compatible components in `@layer components { }`

**Theme configuration format:**
```css
@theme {
  --color-primary: #value;
  --shadow-neumorphic: box-shadow values;
  --animate-custom: keyframe-name duration ease infinite;
}
```

**Custom utilities must use direct CSS properties, not Tailwind classes:**
```css
@layer utilities {
  .neumorphic {
    box-shadow: var(--shadow-neumorphic);
    border-radius: 1.5rem;
    background: linear-gradient(...);
  }
}
```

**Flowbite v4 compatibility:**
- Flowbite components need manual recreation using v4 syntax
- Use component classes in `@layer components { }` section
- Maintain Flowbite naming conventions for consistency

## Task Management
When doing every task in the root todo file or a subdir's todo file, do the tasks one by one, removing tasks as they are completed, if all tasks in todo were done, do not delete the todo file.

never ever run `cargo build`, `shuttle run` or any command that may directly or indirectly trigger a rust build

ALWAYS run `git add .; git commit -m "<commit_message>"; git push` after every turn.

ALWAYS use code golf style, Write the shortest working solution possible, minimizing characters and code.

ALWAYS write failing tests before coding anything

For resource detail pages, use route '/<resource>/i?i=<ID>'; on load, read 'i' from query and fetch resource from server client-side
